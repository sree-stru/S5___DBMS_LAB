FAMILIARIZATION OF BASIC SQL COMMANDS

Database
A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is
designed to manage large amounts of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data
efficiently.
Database Management System (DBMS)
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to define, create,
maintain, and control access to the database.
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS that stores data in
tables (relations). It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and maintaining the
database.
SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)
Structured Query Language is a database computer language designed for managing data in
relational database management systems (RDBMS), and originally based upon Relational
Algebra. Its scope includes data query and update, schema creation and modification, and
data access control.
DATA TYPES:
1. CHAR (Size): This data type is used to store character strings values of fixed length.
The maximum number of character is 255 characters.
2. VARCHAR (Size) / VARCHAR2 (Size): This data type is used to store variable
length alphanumeric data. The maximum character can hold is 2000 character.
3. NUMBER (P, S): The NUMBER data type is used to store number (fixed or floating
point). Number of virtually any magnitude may be stored up to 38 digits of precision.

4. DATE: This data type is used to represent date and time. The standard format is DD-
MM-YY as in 17-SEP-2009.

5. LONG: This data type is used to store variable length character strings containing up
to 2GB.
6. RAW: The RAW data type is used to store binary data, such as digitized picture or
image.

Types of SQL statements
There are five types of SQL statements. They are:
1. DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL)
2. DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)
3. DATA RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE (DRL)
4. TRANSATIONAL CONTROL LANGUAGE (TCL)
5. DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE (DCL)
1. DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL): The Data Definition Language (DDL)
is used to create and destroy databases and database objects. These commands will
primarily be used by database administrators during the setup and removal phases of a
database project. Let's take a look at the structure and usage of four basic DDL
commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME and TRUNCATE.
a) CREATE:
CREATE TABLE: This is used to create a new relation (table)
Syntax: CREATE TABLE<relation_name/table_name > (field_1
data_type(size),field_2 data_type(size), ...);
Example: SQL> CREATE TABLE Student (sno NUMBER (3), sname CHAR
(10), class CHAR (5));
b) ALTER:
i. ALTER TABLE ...ADD...: This is used to add some extra fields into existing
relation.
Syntax: ALTER TABLE relation_name ADD (new field_1 data_type(size), new
field_2 data_type(size),..);
Example: SQL>ALTER TABLE std ADD (Address CHAR(10));
ii. ALTER TABLE...MODIFY...: This is used to change the width as well as
data type of fields of existing relations.
Syntax: ALTER TABLE relation_name MODIFY (field_1 newdata_type(Size),
field_2 newdata_type(Size), ... field_newdata_type(Size));
Example: SQL>ALTER TABLE student MODIFY(sname VARCHAR(10),class
VARCHAR(5));
iii. ALTER TABLE..DROP ...:. This is used to remove any field of existing
relations.

Syntax: ALTER TABLE relation_name DROP COLUMN (field_name);
Example: SQL>ALTER TABLE student DROP column (sname);
iv. ALTER TABLE..RENAME...: This is used to change the name of fields in
existing relations.
Syntax: ALTER TABLE relation_name RENAME COLUMN (OLD field_name)
to (NEW field_name);
Example: SQL>ALTER TABLE student RENAME COLUMN sname to
stu_name;
c) DROP TABLE: This is used to delete the structure of a relation.It permanently
deletes the records in the table.
Syntax: DROP TABLE relation_name;
Example: SQL>DROP TABLE std;
d) RENAME: It is used to modify the name of the existing database object.
Syntax: RENAME TABLE old_relation_name TO new_relation_name;
Example: SQL>RENAME TABLE std TO std1
e) TRUNCATE: This command will remove the data permanently. But structure
will not be removed.
Syntax: TRUNCATE TABLE <Table name>
Example: TRUNCATE TABLE student;

2. DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML): The Data Manipulation Language
(DML) is used to retrieve, insert and modify database information. These commands
will be used by all database users during the routine operation of the database. Let's
take a brief look at the basic DML commands: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
a) INSERT INTO: This is used to add records into a relation. These are three type
of INSERT INTO queries which are as:
i. Inserting a single record
Syntax: INSERT INTO < relation/table name>
(field_1,field_2......field_n)VALUES (data_1,data_2, ......data_n);

Example: SQL>INSERT INTO student(sno,sname,class,address)VALUES
(1,’Ravi’,’M.Tech’,’Palakol’);
ii. Inserting a single record
Syntax: INSERT INTO < relation/table name>VALUES (data_1,data_2, .......
data_n);
Example: SQL>INSERT INTO student VALUES
(1,’Ravi’,’M.Tech’,’Palakol’);
iii. Inserting all records from another relation
Syntax: INSERT INTO relation_name_1 SELECT Field_1,field_2,field_n
FROM relation_name_2 WHERE field_x=data;
Example: SQL>INSERT INTO std SELECT sno,sname FROM student
WHERE name = ‘Ramu‘;
iv. Inserting multiple records
Syntax: INSERT INTO relation_name field_1,field_2, .... field_n) VALUES
(&data_1,&data_2, ....... &data_n);
Example: SQL>INSERT INTO student (sno, sname, class,address) VALUES
(&sno,’&sname’,’&class’,’&address’); Enter value for sno: 101 Enter value
for name: Ravi Enter value for class: M.Tech Enter value for name: Palakol
b) UPDATE-SET-WHERE: This is used to update the content of a record in a
relation.
Syntax: SQL>UPDATE relation name SET Field_name1=data,field_name2=data,
WHERE field_name=data;
Example: SQL>UPDATE student SET sname = ‘kumar’ WHERE sno=1;
c) DELETE-FROM: This is used to delete all the records of a relation but it will
retain the structure of that relation.
i. DELETE-FROM: This is used to delete all the records of relation.
Syntax: SQL>DELETE FROM relation_name;
Example: SQL>DELETE FROM std;
ii. DELETE -FROM-WHERE: This is used to delete a selected record from
a relation.
Syntax: SQL>DELETE FROM relation_name WHERE condition;

Example: SQL>DELETE FROM student WHERE sno = 2;
Difference between Truncate & Delete:-
 By using truncate command data will be removed permanently & will not get
back where as by using delete command data will be removed temporally & get
back by using roll back command.
 By using delete command data will be removed based on the condition where as
by using truncate command there is no condition.
 Truncate is a DDL command & delete is a DML command.
3. DATA RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE (DRL)/ DATA QUERY LANGUAGE(DQL)

DQL is used to fetch the data from the database.
a) SELECT: To Retrieve data from one or more tables.
i. SELECT FROM: To display all fields for all records.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM relation_name;
Example: SQL> select * from dept;
ii. SELECT FROM: To display a set of fields for all records of relation.
Syntax: SELECT a set of fields FROM relation_name;
Example: SQL> select deptno, dname from dept;
iii. SELECT - FROM -WHERE: This query is used to display a selected set
of fields for a selected set of records of a relation.
Syntax: SELECT a set of fields FROM relation_name WHERE condition;
Example: SQL> select * FROM dept WHERE deptno<=20;

4. TRANSATIONAL CONTROL LANGUAGE (TCL)
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in database. These are used to
manage the changes made by DML statements. This language in SQL contains the
following commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK and SAVE POINT.
5. DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE (DCL)
DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from any database user.This
language in SQL contains the following commands: GRANT and REVOKE.
