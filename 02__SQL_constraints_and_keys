CONSTRAINTS AND KEYS

SQL Constraints:
a) NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
b) UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
c) PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
Uniquely identifies each row in a table
d) FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between
tables
e) CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific
condition
f) DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
g) CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database
very quickly
Keys in DBMS:
a) Super Key:
One or more columns that can single out every row, even if they include
extra attributes not strictly needed for uniqueness.
b) Primary Key:
The minimal set of attributes needed to identify a row without any
duplicates or null values.
c) Candidate Key:
Any key that qualifies to become a primary key because it’s both unique
and minimal.
d) Alternate Key:
A candidate key not used as the primary key. It still uniquely identifies
rows, but it isn’t the main choice for the table.
e) Foreign Key :
A column in one table that matches a primary key in another table to keep
their data aligned.

f) Composite Key:
Two or more columns combined to form a unique identifier. Helpful
when no single column can do the job on its own.
g) Unique Key:
Demands that all values differ within a column (or set of columns),
though it typically allows one null. It prevents repeated entries.
